<h1><font face="Georgia" color="white"> Why Photography?</font></h1>
<p class="detail"><font face="Georgia" color="white" size="5px">
What is it about photography which draws us into its realm with such passion.<br><br>
I feel that most people search for answers in life. Some find it in religion or philosophy, some in the act of helping others. Many people find it through their careers and work, or at least try to do so.<br><br>
I know that photographing a landscape brings a sense of balance into my life. It for fills many needs in me, a need to build and create something.  A need to be closely in touch with those things in life which are real and natural; I think it is a counter balance to what can be a  very artificial and unnatural world in which we live and work. Photography for fills a need in me to escape and have time-out, time for me. It enables my yearning to wander, explore and discover.<br><br>
Sometimes I look at people I know,  those who appear to me to be very shallow and have no depth in their life. I find them very curious and interesting. They appear to be happily living lives I see as very superficial and simple.  One side of me is envious. However, I could never live, a life, so wafer thin. I need depth, creativity is my keel and my compass.

<h1><font face="Georgia" color="white"><b>Top Digital Photography Tips</b></font></h1>

<ol>
	
	<li><font face="Georgia" color="white" size="10px">Compose in Thirds</font></li>
	 <p class="detail"><font face="Georgia" color="white" size="5px">To use the rule of thirds, imagine four lines, two lying horizontally across the image and two vertical creating nine even squares. Some images will look best with the focal point in the center square, but placing the subject off center will often create a more aesthetically composed photograph. When a photograph is composed using the rule of thirds the eyes will wander the frame. A picture composed by the rule of thirds is more interesting and pleasing to the eye.</font></p><br>

	 <li><font face="Georgia" color="white" size="10px"><u>Avoid Camera Shake</u></font></li>
	 <p class="detail"><font face="Georgia" color="white" size="5px"> Camera shake or blur is something that can plague any photographer and here are some ways to avoid it. First, you need to learn how to hold your camera properly; use both hands, one around the body and one around the lens and hold the camera close to your body for support. Also make sure you are using a shutter speed that matches the lens focal length. So if you’re using a 100mm lens, then your shutter speed should be no lower than 1/100th of a second. Use a tripod or monopod whenever possible. In lieu of this, use a tree or a wall to stabilize the camera.</font></p><br>

	<li><font face="Georgia" color="white" size="10px"><u>Use a Polarizing Filter</u></font></li>
	<p class="detail"><font face="Georgia" color="white" size="5px"> If you can only buy one filter for your lens, make it a polarizer. This filter helps reduce reflections from water as well as metal and glass; it improves the colors of the sky and foliage, and it will protect your lens too. There’s no reason why you can’t leave it on for all of your photography. The recommended kind of polarizer is circular because these allow your camera to use TTL (through the lens) metering</font></p><br>

	<li><font face="Georgia" color="white" size="10px"><u>Use Simple Backgrounds</u></font></li>
	<p class="detail"><font face="Georgia" color="white" size="5px">The simple approach is usually the best in digital photography, and you have to decide what needs to be in the shot, while not including anything that is a distraction. If possible, choose a plain background – in other words, neutral colors and simple patterns. You want the eye to be drawn to the focal point of the image rather than a patch of color or an odd building in the background. This is vital in a shot where the model is placed off center. </font></p><br>

	<li><font face="Georgia" color="white" size="10px"><u>Choose the Right ISO</u></font></li>
	<p class="detail"><font face="Georgia" color="white" size="5px"> The ISO setting determines how sensitive your camera is to light and also how fine the grain of your image. The ISO we choose depends on the situation – when it’s dark we need to push the ISO up to a higher number, say anything from 400 – 3200 as this will make the camera more sensitive to light and then we can avoid blurring. On sunny days we can choose ISO 100 or the Auto setting as we have more light to work with.</font></p><br>

	<li><font face="Georgia" color="white" size="10px"><u>Experiment with Shutter Speed</u></font></li>
	<p class="detail"><font face="Georgia" color="white" size="5px"> Don’t be afraid to play with the shutter speed to create some interesting effects. When taking a night time shot, use a tripod and try shooting with the shutter speed set at 4 seconds. You will see that the movement of the object is captured along with some light trails. If you choose a faster shutter speed of say 1/250th of a second, the trails will not be as long or bright; instead you will freeze the action. This technique works well if you are using a tripod and if you are photographing a moving object</font></p><br>
